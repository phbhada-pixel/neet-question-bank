# ४. प्रश्न मागवणे (अचूक प्रॉम्प्ट - NEET Pattern, Bloom's Taxonomy, Mixed Types, LaTeX, Quality Score)
prompt = f"""Generate exactly 20 UNIQUE multiple choice questions for NEET exam on the Subject: '{subject}' 
and Chapter: '{chapter}'. STRICTLY base all your questions ONLY on the following NTA NEET 2025 topics: {topics}. 
Make sure these are not the most common questions. Return ONLY a valid JSON array of objects. 
Keys must be exactly: 'question', 'optionA', 'optionB', 'optionC', 'optionD', 'correctOption', 'explanation', 
and a 'quality_score' object with keys: 'difficulty_score', 'concept_coverage', 'language', 'neet_similarity', 'distractor_quality', 'overall_score'.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR QUALITY SCORE:
- Rate each parameter from 0-100 based on NEET standards.
- Calculate 'overall_score' as the average of the 5 parameters.
- If a question is too simple, has ambiguous options, or does not meet high NEET standards, give it a low score (< 80).

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR DIFFICULTY LEVEL:
Distribute the 20 questions strictly according to the previous 10 years NEET exam pattern:
- 5 questions of 'Easy' difficulty
- 9 questions of 'Medium' difficulty
- 5 questions of 'Hard' difficulty
- 1 question of 'Very Difficult / Advanced Conceptual' difficulty

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR BLOOM'S TAXONOMY & QUESTION TYPES:
Design the 20 questions to target the following Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, combining them with appropriate question types:
- REMEMBER (4 questions): Direct recall of facts, definitions, standard values. (Use 'Direct conceptual' type)
- UNDERSTAND (5 questions): Explaining ideas or concepts. (Use 'Statement based' or 'Direct conceptual' types)
- APPLY (5 questions): Using formulas, calculating values. (Use 'Numerical/Application based' type)
- ANALYSE (4 questions): Finding relationships. (Use 'Assertion-Reason' or 'Match the following' types)
- EVALUATE (2 questions): Judging validity of complex statements. (Use 'Multi conceptual' type)

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. MATCH THE FOLLOWING: put Column I and Column II entirely within the 'question' key. 
2. LINE BREAKS: DO NOT use real line breaks in the text, use the escaped literal string '\\n' for new lines. 
3. MATHEMATICAL/SCIENCE FORMULAS: You MUST use LaTeX format. 
   - Enclose inline formulas using a single $ sign (e.g., $180^\\circ$). 
   - You MUST double-escape all LaTeX backslashes for valid JSON (e.g., use $\\\\frac{{a}}{{b}}$ instead of $\\frac{{a}}{{b}}$ and $180^\\\\circ$ instead of $180^\\circ$).
4. CHEMISTRY FORMULAS: For organic structures use condensed plain text (e.g., CH3-CH2-OH). DO NOT draw ASCII structures.
5. Output strictly valid JSON without any markdown formatting.
